teak teak is a close grained hardwood with a high natural oil content this makes it hard wearing highly resistant to rotting and almost impervious to the effects of sun rain frost or snow these characteristics combine to make it the ideal timber for all outdoor applications only premium grade plantationgrown teak is used for the manufacture of gloster furniture the features of premium grade teak are a straight grain structure the absence of knots splits or cracks and an even overall colour indoor use gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour if you intend to use your furniture indoors or under cover outside where it will not get wet the teak will retain much of its original colour and the soft sheen of its buffed finish any marks stains or damage to the buffed teak finish can be restored using the gloster buffed teak repair kit outdoor use gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour as with natural finish teak left to age naturally outside buffed teak will gradually change to a soft silvergrey as the pigments in the surface layer of the wood begin to fade away after the first few exposures to water you should also expect the surface grain to rise slightly as a part of the buffing process the surface is wetted before final sanding to raise the grain so there will be significantly less raised grain on buffed teak than on natural finish teak we recommend that you allow your teak furniture to weather naturally this way and simply clean thoroughly once or twice a year with our teak cleaner buffed teak furniture may also benefit from an occasional light sanding to remove any raised grain and restore a smooth finish to the surface under no circumstances should a power washer be used to clean teak furniture as this will erode the surface because teak is a naturally oily wood it is not possible to paint or varnish any paint or varnish applied will not adhere properly to the surface and after a short while will start to peel off if you wish to retain the goldenbrown colour of new teak we also offer a teak sealer application of teak sealer will not affect the strength or longevity of the furniture in any way just its appearance if you elect to use teak sealer you will be embarking on a regular maintenance programme as teak sealer needs to be regularly reapplied to provide continuous protection if you intend to store your furniture over the winter we recommend that you do so in a watertight garden shed or garage however we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause the wood to split to protect teak surfaces from staining and to help maintain the silvergrey patina on weathered teak we recommend using our teak protector our teak protector creates an almost invisible shield which helps to prevent food coffee ketchup red wine olive oil etc penetrating into the teak and causing unsightly stains teak protector also helps protects the wood against the ingress of moisture the adhesion of dirt and prevents mildew growth collections using teak
